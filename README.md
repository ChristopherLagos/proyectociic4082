# proyectociic4082
This is a proyect for the Computer Architecture II class for the Fall semester 2023-2024.
The porpose of this project is to demonstrate our Assembly knowledge by making a simple game
for the nintendo's NES. The project required us to make a background with at least 4 elements
one which had to be a plataform in the middle, create a character using sprites, animate said
character, and finally mapping the controller imputs in order to control the character. For
the last part it was necesarry to implement collisions so that the character could stand on
the plataform/ground and not leave the edges of the screen.

The following videos quickly explain and go through the implementation of each of the
projects parts. The videos where recorded by me and are in spanish.
